# Color settings for the Cygwin mintty terminal

Based on the solarized color scheme by Ethan Schoonover. See full
details at http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

This project can be found at
https://github.com/mavnn/mintty-colors-solarized and is designed to be
included as a subtree of https://github.com/altercation/solarized

Copy the two files into a directory in your home (for example .solar) 
and add one of the following lines to your .bashrc file:

source ~/%your directory%/sol.light

or

source ~/%your directory%/sol.dark

Color schemes can be swapped interactively using the same commands.
